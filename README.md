## 📌 Tasks Summary

### ✅ Task 01: Global Country Distribution Analysis

- **Objective:** Analyze and visualize the distribution of countries across various regions and income groups using real-world data.

- **Key Visuals Created:**
  1. 📊 *Stacked Bar Chart* — Displays income group distribution within each region.
  2. 📉 *Horizontal Bar Chart* — Shows the number of countries per region.

- **Tools & Techniques:**
  - Power BI for interactive data visualizations
  - Categorical data analysis to detect income-based patterns
  - Data preprocessing and transformation for clean, insightful visuals

- **Outcome:**  
  These visualizations provide valuable insights into **geopolitical income patterns**, aiding in better understanding of regional development disparities and supporting data-driven global analysis.

### ✅ Task 02: Titanic Dataset — Data Cleaning & EDA

- **Objective:** Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset (Kaggle) to understand the variables influencing passenger survival.

- **Key Activities:**
  - 🧹 Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and fixing inconsistencies.
  - 🔍 Explored feature relationships such as:
    - Survival Rate vs Gender
    - Survival Rate vs Age
    - Survival Rate vs Fare
    - Survival Rate vs Passenger Class
  - 📈 Used bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps to uncover patterns, trends, and outliers.

- **Tools & Libraries:**
  - `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`

- **Outcome:**  
  Gained strong practical exposure to data profiling and visualization, which helped in drawing actionable insights about survival factors on the Titanic.

### ✅ Task 03: Decision Tree Classifier — Customer Subscription Prediction

- **Objective:** Build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service, using their demographic and behavioral attributes.

- **Key Insights & Findings:**
  - 🔹 **Age vs Subscription Trend:**  
    Customers aged **30–40** showed the highest response volume. Subscriptions dropped sharply after age 60, while younger individuals had lower conversion despite high numbers.

  - 🔹 **Education Level Impact:**  
    Customers with education level `'4'` had a **subscription success rate > 20%**, indicating strong targeting potential. Lower education levels correlated with reduced success.

  - 🌳 **Model Performance & Metrics:**
    - **Overall Accuracy:** ~89.7%
    - **Precision & Recall Breakdown:**
      - Class `0` (No Subscription): Precision **0.91**, Recall **0.98**
      - Class `1` (Subscribed): Precision **0.61**, Recall **0.26**

- **Model Techniques:**
  - Built a fully interpretable **Decision Tree** to visualize feature importance.
  - Model results were visualized to enhance understanding for stakeholders and guide data-driven marketing strategies.

- **Tools & Libraries:**
  - `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`

- **Outcome:**  
  Developed a predictive model with transparent logic, enabling effective interpretation and support for **targeted campaign planning**.

### ✅ Task 04: U.S. Road Safety Data Analysis

- **Objective:** Analyze U.S. traffic accident data and visualize patterns related to road conditions, weather, time of day, and accident hotspots.

- **Key Findings:**
  - 🚗 California recorded the highest number of accidents.
  - 🕗 Accident peaks were observed at 8 AM and 5 PM (rush hours).
  - 🌤️ Most accidents occurred even during ‘Fair’ or ‘Clear’ weather.
  - 🌫️ Poor visibility correlated with higher accident severity.
  - 🗺️ Major hotspots detected around Los Angeles, New York, and Washington D.C. via heatmaps.

- **Tools & Visuals:**
  - Bar charts, box plots, KDE plots (`Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`)
  - Geospatial heatmaps (`Folium`)

- **Skills Gained:**
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Geospatial Visualization
  - Deriving insights from real-world accident datasets
